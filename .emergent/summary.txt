The previous AI engineer was tasked with developing a real-time Pakistani Sign Language Translation application for Urdu and Pashto, leveraging YOLOv5. Initially, a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB web application was built, starting with mocked AI services to quickly achieve an MVP. Key milestones included establishing the UI, expanding a mock gesture dataset to 132 entries, and integrating MediaPipe for real hand detection, though this integration was later reported by the user as non-functional for actual gesture recognition and translation. The conversation concluded with a significant pivot: the user reported persistent issues with real-time hand detection and all translation functionalities, requesting a complete refactor to a simplified, script-based Python application focused solely on YOLOv5, with a new, flatter directory structure. The AI engineer began implementing this new architecture, creating the core Python scripts and a placeholder model file.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to bridge the communication gap for hearing-impaired individuals in Pakistan by developing a real-time sign language translation application for Urdu and Pashto. The application should use YOLOv5 for accurate hand gesture recognition.

**Key Requirements and Features:**
*   **Bidirectional Translation**: Support both Sign-to-Speech and Speech-to-Sign translation.
*   **Text-to-Sign**: Allow users to input text and receive corresponding sign animations.
*   **Language Support**: Primarily Urdu and Pashto sign languages.
*   **Real-time Processing**: Enable live camera-based gesture recognition and translation.
*   **User Interface**: A complete web interface with live video processing capabilities.
*   **Dataset**: Utilize a dataset of Pakistani sign gestures. Initially, a mock dataset was requested for demonstration, with a framework for future training.
*   **AI Model**: Implement YOLOv5 for gesture detection and classification.
*   **Speech Integration**: Integrate speech recognition (Google Speech API preferred) for Urdu/Pashto and text-to-speech (gTTS/pyttsx3).
*   **Mobile Compatibility**: The application should be fully responsive and work on mobile browsers.

**Problem Solved by the Product:**
Millions of deaf individuals in Pakistan face exclusion from digital communication due to a lack of local apps supporting Urdu or Pashto sign language, absence of real-time gesture recognition tools for mobile use, and inability to translate speech to sign and vice versa on the go. This project aims to provide an accessible, real-time, offline, and bilingual solution to mitigate social isolation and enhance educational/professional opportunities for the deaf community.

<code_architecture>
The project initially adopted a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database. However, a recent user request initiated a pivot to a simplified, script-based Python application, discarding the web framework.

**Directory Structure (Latest Requested):**



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file is intended to store the trained YOLOv5 model weights.
    -   **Changes Made**: A placeholder file was created; its actual content for a trained model is pending. This is crucial for the real AI model's inference.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This script will handle the logic for capturing real-time hand gestures from a camera, processing them with the YOLOv5 model, and converting the recognized signs into spoken Urdu/Pashto text.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was newly created as part of the refactor, replacing the previous FastAPI backend's mock gesture detection and sign-to-speech logic. Its full implementation is in progress.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This script will manage the process of taking spoken input in Urdu or Pashto, recognizing keywords, and displaying corresponding sign language animations or images.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file was newly created during the refactor, replacing the previous web application's speech-to-sign functionality. Its full implementation is in progress.

-   ** (or )**:
    -   **Summary**: This file will store the mapping between detected gestures (e.g., YOLOv5 class IDs) and their corresponding Urdu, Pashto, and English translations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of a major architectural pivot. The user reported that the previously built full-stack web application (React frontend, FastAPI backend with MediaPipe for hand detection) was not performing real-time hand gesture recognition or any form of bidirectional translation (Sign↔Speech, Speech↔Sign, Text↔Sign) as expected.

In response, the AI engineer has initiated a complete overhaul of the application, moving away from the web-based setup to a more localized, Python script-based approach, explicitly following a new directory structure requested by the user.

**Current State of the Product:**
The web application developed in the earlier stages is now superseded by a new set of Python scripts.
*   **Codebase Transition**: The  and  directories from the previous web app are effectively being replaced by a new  directory.
*   **New File Creation**: The AI engineer has created the foundational files for the new architecture within the  directory:
    *   : Intended for real-time sign recognition and conversion to speech.
    *   : Intended for speech recognition and conversion to sign visuals.
    *   : To map gestures to their text translations.
    *   : A placeholder for the trained YOLOv5 model weights.
    *   : New documentation for this simplified structure.
*   **Focus Shift**: The current focus is on building the core AI functionalities within these new Python scripts, specifically addressing the user's concerns about actual hand detection and translation.
*   **Outstanding Nuisance**: The  file is currently a placeholder, meaning the actual YOLOv5 model for real-time inference is not yet integrated or trained. The previous MediaPipe integration, which the user stated was not functional for actual gesture *recognition*, has likely been abandoned in favor of a pure YOLOv5 approach as requested. The TTS/STT parts are also likely not truly functional yet under this new architecture.

The last action performed was to fix a syntax error within the newly created scripts and to ensure the  file was in place, indicating that the immediate task is to get these new core Python scripts ready for the actual AI processing.
