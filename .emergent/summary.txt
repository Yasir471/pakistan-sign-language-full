The AI engineer's trajectory began with a pivotal shift from a non-functional full-stack web application (React/FastAPI/MongoDB) to a simplified, script-based Python application focused on YOLOv5 for Pakistani Sign Language (PSL) translation. Initial work involved setting up the core  scripts, a mock 132-gesture dataset, and Google Speech API integration. A key user request introduced a 3D animated character, which was initially implemented as standalone Python scripts.

The development became iterative, with the user reporting numerous issues in the web frontend's preview (outdated text, non-functional 3D character, broken speech). The AI systematically debugged and refactored both the React frontend and FastAPI backend, removing unwanted references and ensuring functional translation modes. A major breakthrough was the integration of a real-time, embedded 3D avatar directly into the React UI using , fulfilling the user's vision of a professional translation app. The session concluded with a user request for multi-modal output based on a video, which the AI cannot directly analyze, prompting a request for clarification.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a real-time Pakistani Sign Language (PSL) translation application for Urdu and Pashto, primarily for the hearing-impaired. Key features include bidirectional translation (Sign-to-Speech, Speech-to-Sign), Text-to-Sign, and real-time camera-based gesture recognition using YOLOv5. The application requires a responsive web interface with live video processing and a PSL gesture dataset (expanded to 132 gestures). Integration with Google Speech API for Urdu/Pashto speech recognition and gTTS/pyttsx3 for text-to-speech is essential. Recent enhancements include an embedded, real-time 3D animated avatar in the web interface that dynamically performs sign language gestures for all translation modes, and an interactive storytelling feature with a classic Pakistani story (انگور تو کھٹے ہیں). The product aims to provide an accessible, real-time, and bilingual solution to mitigate social isolation and enhance opportunities for the deaf community in Pakistan.

The project evolved from a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB web application, through a brief pivot to isolated Python scripts, and ultimately to an enhanced web application integrated with these Python scripts.

**Current Directory Structure (Evolved):**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component orchestrating the user interface, managing application state, handling API interactions, and displaying all translation modes including the embedded 3D avatar.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to remove deprecated text, integrate the  component, manage 3D avatar state, and call backend endpoints for all translation functionalities.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created React component responsible for rendering the real-time 3D sign language avatar directly within the web UI, utilizing  and . This file actualizes the user's vision for an interactive in-browser 3D character.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created to implement the embedded 3D avatar, handling its display and animation based on gestures received.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: The FastAPI backend acting as the central API gateway for the frontend. It processes requests, interacts with AI/speech services (through  scripts), and bridges the web application to the Python-based 3D character logic.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to remove outdated MediaPipe references, introduce a  endpoint, refine speech recognition and text-to-sign endpoints to align with frontend data expectations, and return 3D character instructions/status.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file is intended to hold the trained YOLOv5 model weights for gesture recognition. It's crucial for the application's core AI functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: A general  model was downloaded and renamed to  as a placeholder. The model is not yet trained for specific Pakistani sign language gestures.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Real YOLOv5 Model Training**: The  file currently holds a general YOLOv5 model; a model specifically trained on Pakistani sign language gestures (132 gestures) needs to be developed and integrated.
-   **Full Multi-modal Output**: Implement the functionality where a single input (speech, text, or hand sign) generates output in all three forms: sign language animation, corresponding text display, and speech output.
-   **Clarify Video Functionality**: The user has provided a video () as an example for desired multi-modal output, but its specific behaviors need to be described by the user as the AI cannot directly analyze video content.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a real-time, embedded 3D animated avatar directly within the React frontend. This feature significantly upgrades the user experience by enabling dynamic sign language demonstrations within the web interface for various inputs.

The specific actions taken include:
1.  **Frontend 3D Avatar Integration**: New libraries (, ) were added, and a  component was created to render the 3D avatar. This avatar is now prominently displayed in .
2.  **Avatar State Management**:  was updated with  and  states, along with an  helper, to control the avatar's actions based on user interactions.
3.  **Mode Integration**: All translation modes (Sign-to-Speech, Speech-to-Sign, Text-to-Sign, and Story Mode) were modified to trigger animations on this new embedded 3D avatar, replacing the previous text-based status messages.
4.  **Backend Adjustments**: The backend () was updated to correctly handle requests related to the 3D character, although the actual rendering is now client-side.
5.  **Speech and Text Functionality**: Speech recognition and text-to-sign were thoroughly debugged in both frontend and backend to ensure correct translation and triggering of avatar animations.
6.  **UI Cleanup**: All remaining unwanted text and Emergent platform references were removed from the frontend.

The system now features a fully integrated 3D avatar that dynamically displays gestures in real-time, achieving parity with professional sign language translation applications. The last user interaction was a request for the application to provide multi-modal output (sign, text, and speech simultaneously) for any input, referencing an uploaded video artifact which the AI is unable to process.
